# WSU CptS 223 for Fall 2022
This repository includes all C++ programming assignments for my Fall 2022 semester. The class focused heavily on data structures and time complexity, with an introduction to the Git workflow. It is not necessarily a reflection of my current skills and understanding.

As the class required using Microsoft WSL and CMake for submitting assignments, all ``CMakeLists.txt`` files are included. This was created by merging previous assignment repositories into a single master repository for better organization.
